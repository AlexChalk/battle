# Battle

A (very) basic web application that lets you battle your friends.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:adc17/takeaway-challenge.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd path/to/dir` then `bundle install`. 

## Usage

1. Start a local server: `rackup -p 4567`, then navigate to `localhost:4567`.
2. Enter player names and start playing.

## Tests

To test, navigate to the project root and run `rspec`.

## Other Implementaions

At Makers Academy, we switch pair partners each day and work on whoever's version of the project is least advanced. I wrote code for other students' repos [here](https://github.com/adamerdemer/battle) and [here](https://github.com/sblausten/battle-alex).

## Other Info

Built using Sinatra during week three of the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) Bootcamp.
